## Running Tests

### Cypress Tests
- To run Cypress e2e tests, make sure the backend is running.
- Use the following command to open Cypress: npx cypress open

- After opening Cypress, you will see the configured e2e tests. Note that if tests are failing, you may need to try running them 2-3 times, as sometimes responses are not received in time due to Cypress's fast execution.
- **Important**: For Cypress tests, use the credentials `jovana@example.com` and `12345` for authorization.

### Karma and Jasmine Tests
